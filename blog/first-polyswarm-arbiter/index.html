<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hatching has integrated Cuckoo Sandbox as <a href="https://polyswarm.io/press/2018/02/26/polyswarm-partners-with-cuckoo-sandbox/">the first Arbiter of PolySwarms
threat intelligence marketplace</a>. This blog post is the first in a series of
posts and will touch on basic function of an Arbiter, why PolySwarm selected
Cuckoo Sandbox as the first Arbiter, how this process works, and finally, what
we see as the main benefit of being an Arbiter.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-arbiter">What is an Arbiter?</h2>
<p>Literally, an Arbiter is somebody who is tasked with making difficult decisions
in light of conflicting interests. In the case of the PolySwarm threat
intelligence marketplace, that means judging the potential malicious intent of
file samples: a sort of cat and mouse game between security analysts and
malware authors. In the end, the verdict of the Arbiters will form what is
called the Ground Truth, a final decision on the intent of a sample.</p>
<p>In order to make a valid judgment an Arbiter must utilize the analytical
resources it has at its disposal and collect evidence regarding the behavior
and intent of a sample. Over time, the accuracy of verdicts for more difficult
samples can be improved by learning from judgments made by other Arbiters and
domain experts and by responding to emerging threats.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-we-become-the-first-arbiter">How did we become the first Arbiter?</h2>
<p>PolySwarm picked Hatching as the first Arbiter for the threat intelligence
marketplace because Hatching has been the driving force behind Cuckoo Sandbox
over the past few years, the world&rsquo;s leading open source malware analysis
system. The open source nature of Cuckoo Sandbox aligns with the transparent,
collaborative spirit that underlies cryptocurrencies, and allows anyone to
audit and improve the code. Additionally, through its open source nature,
Cuckoo Sandbox is used by many researchers and organizations around the world.</p>
<p>As Steve Bassi, CEO of PolySwarm, points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cuckoo Sandbox takes an
innovative, dynamic approach to malware detection. We’re thrilled to have
Jurriaan’s team on board as PolySwarm’s first Arbiter. Partnerships with
marquee teams such as Hatching&rsquo;s are crucial to PolySwarm’s disruption of the
threat intelligence ecosystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_sbassi">Steve Bassi</a>, Polyswarm CEO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We strongly believe in the community driven approach that PolySwarm is taking
to revolutionize the antivirus industry. Therefore, we are honored that
PolySwarm has chosen us as their first Arbiter.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Arbiters listen for bounties placed on the PolySwarm network. It fetches file
samples (artifacts) that belong to the bounty and dispatches them to the
analysis backends. In some cases, for example when experiencing high volumes,
there might be a limited period of time in which a vote has to be cast. The
duration of the analysis and subsequent processing may be limited as well. Our
Arbiter allows multiple backends to be consulted and is able to vote even if
not all analyses can be performed in time.</p>
<p>In rare cases, voting does not result in a satisfactory result, for example if
the verdicts/scores produced by the analytical backends are not conclusive,
manual voting may be required. Manual voting requires a human operator to make
the final call. The operator has access to a dashboard from which they can view
the detailed analysis reports. This report helps the operator to improve on the
verdict/scoring, while offering feedback to the marketplace on improving their
scoring at the same time</p>
<p>Once the voting window closes and the verdicts are revealed, the Arbiter may
use different sources of information for the final Ground Truth. The way we’ve
set this up is by determining our own “vote” - through the various analysis
backends - and using that as a basis for the ground truth. If it is determined
that there’s a large gap between our conclusion and that of the network, the
Arbiter may devote additional effort to verify claims made by Micro-engines and
Security Experts before pushing out the final Ground Truth, based on which the
different players in the platform are paid.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-benefit-of-being-an-arbiter">What is the benefit of being an Arbiter?</h2>
<p>Apart from the usual business benefits, the real benefit of being an Arbiter is
actually quite simple: we get to analyze lots and lots of samples.</p>
<p>Analyzing all these samples allows us to improve the analysis capabilities of
Cuckoo Sandbox by continuously learning from all the analyses we perform. To
us, this offers a major R&amp;D advantage as we get the opportunity to continuously
test and develop our system in a real-world environment.</p>
<p>For example, when supporting clients that operate a Cuckoo Sandbox environment,
we aren&rsquo;t always able to use the results of their analyses to further improve
Cuckoo Sandbox for the community. But as an Arbiter for PolySwarm, we have a
constant stream of new malware intelligence to work with. This is of great
importance for the development and ultimately the future of Cuckoo Sandbox.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Becoming PolySwarm’s first Arbiter has been of significance to us, as it
provides us with the opportunity to contribute to a new paradigm in threat
protection coverage while at the same time continuously developing the analysis
capabilities of Cuckoo Sandbox.</p>
<p>We encourage others to join PolySwarm in their endeavor to revolutionize
the antivirus market, as more arbiters means more analyses. We are looking
forward to comparing analyses results, to learn learning from other arbiters
and to improve the overall results as this all contributes to increasing
general security while lowering the cost required to do so.</p>
